This version of mod_auth_openidc has no dependency to Redis libs or backend, so it's a easier to compile for stable debian systems.


mod_auth_openidc
================

**mod_auth_openidc** is an authentication/authorization module for the Apache 2.x
HTTP server that authenticates users against an OpenID Connect Provider. It can also
function as an OAuth 2.0 Resource Server, validating access tokens presented by
OAuth 2.0 clients against an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server.
  
Overview
--------

This module enables an Apache 2.x web server to operate as an [OpenID Connect]
(http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) *Relying Party* (RP) to an
OpenID Connect *Provider* (OP). It authenticates users against an OpenID Connect Provider,
receives user identity information from the OP in a so called ID Token and passes the
identity information (a.k.a. claims) in the ID Token to applications hosted and protected
by the Apache web server.

It can also be configured as an OAuth 2.0 Resource Server, consuming bearer access
tokens and introspecting/validating them against a token introspection endpoint of an
OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server, authorizing clients based on the introspection results.

The protected content and/or applications can be served by the Apache server
itself or it can be served from elsewhere when Apache is configured as a reverse
proxy in front of the origin server(s).

By default the module sets the `REMOTE_USER` variable to the `id_token` `[sub]` claim,
concatenated with the OP's Issuer identifier (`[sub]@[iss]`). Other `id_token`
claims are passed in HTTP headers together with those (optionally) obtained from
the UserInfo endpoint.

It allows for authorization rules (based on standard Apache `Require` primitives)
that can be matched against the set of claims provided in the `id_token`/
`userinfo` claims.

This module supports all defined OpenID Connect flows, including *Basic Client Profile*,
*Implicit Client Profile*, *Hybrid Flows* and the *Refresh Flow*. It supports connecting
to multiple OpenID Connect Providers through reading/writing provider metadata files
in a specified metadata directory.

It supports [OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration]
(http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html) and [OpenID Provider
Discovery] (http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html) through domain
or account names.

It supports [OpenID Connect Session Management draft 21]
(http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html). See the [Wiki]
(https://github.com/pingidentity/mod_auth_openidc/wiki) for information
on how to configure it.

Additionally it can operate as an OAuth 2.0 Resource Server to an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server,
introspecting/validating bearer Access Tokens conforming to [OAuth Token Introspection]
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-introspection-00) or similar. The `REMOTE_USER`
variable setting, passing claims in HTTP headers and authorization based on Require primitives
works in the same way as described for OpenID Connect above.

For an exhaustive description of all configuration options, see the file `auth_openidc.conf`
in this directory. This file can also serve as an include file for `httpd.conf`.

How to Use It  
-------------

###Sample Config for Google Accounts

Sample configuration for using Google as your OpenID Connect Provider running on
`www.example.com` and `https://www.example.com/example/redirect_uri` registered
as the *redirect_uri* for the client through the Google API Console. You will also
have to enable the `Google+ API` under `APIs & auth` in the [Google API console]
(https://console.developers.google.com).

    OIDCProviderMetadataURL https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
    OIDCClientID <your-client-id-administered-through-the-google-api-console>
    OIDCClientSecret <your-client-secret-administered-through-the-google-api-console>

    OIDCRedirectURI https://www.example.com/example/redirect_uri
    OIDCCryptoPassphrase <password>

    <Location /example/>
       AuthType openid-connect
       Require valid-user
    </Location>

Note if you want to securely restrict logins to a specific Google Apps domain you would not only
add the `hd=<your-domain>` setting to the `OIDCAuthRequestParams` primitive for skipping the Google Account
Chooser screen, but you must also ask for the `profile` scope using `OIDCScope` and use a `Require claim`
authorization setting in the `Location` primitive similar to:

    OIDCScope "openid profile"
    Require claim hd:<your-domain>

The above is an authorization example of an exact match of a provided claim against a string value.
You can also match claim values against regular expressions by using `claim~<expression>` instead of
`claim:<literal>`, e.g.:

    Require claim "name~\w+ Jones$"

to match all users with last name Jones and a single first name (i.e. roughly equivalent to `Require claim family_name:Jones`).

###Sample Config for Multiple OpenID Connect Providers

Sample configuration for multiple OpenID Connect providers, which triggers OP
discovery first.

`OIDCMetadataDir` points to a directory that contains files that contain per-provider
configuration data. For each provider, there are 3 types of files in the directory:

1. `<urlencoded-issuer-value-with-https-prefix-and-trailing-slash-stripped>.provider`  
contains (standardized) OpenID Connect Discovery OP JSON metadata where each
name of the file is the url-encoded issuer name of the OP that is described
by the metadata in that file.

2. `<urlencoded-issuer-value-with-https-prefix-and-trailing-slash-stripped>.client`  
contains statically configured or dynamically registered Dynamic Client Registration
specific JSON metadata (based on the OpenID Connect Client Registration specification)
and the filename is the url-encoded issuer name of the OP that this client is registered
with. Sample client metadata for issuer `https://localhost:9031`, so the client metadata
filename is `localhost%3A9031.client`:

        {
            "client_id" : "ac_oic_client",
            "client_secret" : "abc123DEFghijklmnop4567rstuvwxyzZYXWUT8910SRQPOnmlijhoauthplaygroundapplication"
        }

3. `<urlencoded-issuer-value-with-https-prefix-and-trailing-slash-stripped>.conf`  
contains **mod_auth_openidc** specific custom JSON metadata that can be used to overrule
some of the settings defined in `auth_openidc.conf` on a per-client basis. The filename
is the URL-encoded issuer name of the OP that this client is registered with.

Entries that can be included in the .conf file are:

    "ssl_validate_server"                overrides OIDCSSLValidateServer (value 0 or 1...)
    "scope"                              overrides OIDCScope 
    "response_type"                      overrides OIDCResponseType 
    "response_mode"                      overrides OIDCResponseMode 
    "client_name"                        overrides OIDCClientName 
    "client_contact"                     overrides OIDCClientContact 
    "idtoken_iat_slack"                  overrides OIDCIDTokenIatSlack
    "jwks_refresh_interval"              overrides OIDCJWKSRefreshInterval
    "client_jwks_uri"                    overrides OIDCClientJwksUri
    "id_token_signed_response_alg"       overrides OIDCIDTokenSignedResponseAlg
    "id_token_encrypted_response_alg"    overrides OIDCIDTokenEncryptedResponseAlg
    "id_token_encrypted_response_enc"    overrides OIDCIDTokenEncryptedResponseEnc
    "userinfo_signed_response_alg"       overrides OIDCUserInfoSignedResponseAlg
    "userinfo_encrypted_response_alg"    overrides OIDCUserInfoEncryptedResponseAlg
    "userinfo_encrypted_response_enc"    overrides OIDCUserInfoEncryptedResponseEnc
    "auth_request_params"                overrides OIDCAuthRequestParams
    "token_endpoint_params"              overrides OIDCProviderTokenEndpointParams
    "registration_endpoint_json"         overrides OIDCProviderRegistrationEndpointJson
    "registration_token"                 an access_token that will be used on client registration calls for the associated OP

Sample client metadata for issuer `https://localhost:9031`, so the **mod_auth_openidc**
configuration filename is `localhost%3A9031.conf`:

    {
        "ssl_validate_server" : 0,
        "scope" : "openid email profile"
    }
  
And the related **mod_auth_openidc** Apache config section:

    OIDCMetadataDir <somewhere-writable-for-the-apache-process>/metadata

    OIDCRedirectURI https://www.example.com/example/redirect_uri/
    OIDCCryptoPassphrase <password>

    <Location /example/>
       AuthType openid-connect
       Require valid-user
    </Location>

If you do not want to use the internal discovery page (you really shouldn't...), you
can have the user being redirected to an external discovery page by setting
`OIDCDiscoveryURL`. That URL will be accessed with 2 parameters, `oidc_callback` and
`target_link_uri` (both URLs). The `target_link_uri` parameter value needs to be returned to the
`oidc_callback` URL (again in the `target_link_uri parameter`) together with an
`iss` parameter that contains the URL-encoded issuer value of the
selected Provider, or a URL-encoded account name for OpenID Connect Discovery
purposes (aka. e-mail style identifier), or a domain name.

Sample callback:

    <oidc_callback>?target_link_uri=<target_link_uri>&iss=[<issuer>|<domain>|<e-mail-style-account-name>][&login_hint=<name>][&auth_request_params=<urlencoded-query-string>]

This is also the OpenID Connect specified way of triggering 3rd party initiated SSO 
to a specific provider when multiple OPs have been configured. In that case the callback
may also contain a "login_hint" parameter with the login identifier the user might use to log in.

An additional **mod_auth_openidc** specific parameter named `auth_request_params` may also be passed
in, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/pingidentity/mod_auth_openidc/wiki#10-how-can-i-add-custom-parameters-to-the-authorization-request)
for its usage.
